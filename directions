  DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIONS FOR COQTAIL

New axiomatics
  Motivations
    - stdlib's axiomatics is not constructive and implies Markov (and it is bad)
    - C-CoRN abuses of Set (for the excluded middle for example) (and use heavy notations)
  Goals for provability
    - (C-CoRN reals) ≤ (coqtail's reals)
    - note: in CoRN/Rreals.v they show (R ⊧ CReals)
    - Be able to convert most stdlib's proofs into coqtail's reals
  Choice of axiomatics
    RECALL STDLIB's real numbers
      - R 0 1 + * 1/ - <
      - up : R -> Z
      - operations
          +comm +assoc r+-r=0 0+r=r
          *comm *assoc /r*r=1 1*r=r
          +*distr
      - order :
          1<>0
          total_order {<}+{=}+{>}
          <asym <trans +<compat *<compat
      - archimed
          forall r:R, IZR (up r) > r /\ IZR (up r) - r <= 1
      - completeness
          forall E:R -> Prop,
            bound E -> (exists x : R, E x) -> { m:R | is_lub E m }.
    RECALL C-CoRN's real numbers
      - R : ordered field
        - ring
            abeliangroup 1 * + (setoids) +*distr *assoc *1monoid 1#0
        - field
            ring +
            x#0 → /x * x = 1
        - ordered :
            < ≤ > ≥
            (< is a strict order)
            <+ compat
            0<x → 0<y → 0<x*y
            x#y iff x<y or y<x
            relations between ≤<, ><, ≥≤
      - lim : build x ∈ R from a cauchy sequence (which is indeed the limit)
    
    Discussion
      - C-CoRN has an interesting framework and has some problems but it would be
      very interesting to list them all:
        - forces the usage of the excluded middle in Set, whereas EM in Prop is 
            morally enough
        - horrible notations and abbreviations (a quick tutorial may fix that)
    
    Constructive:
      what about building as R as Q with an upper bound ?

Hierarchy
  maybe it will be interesting to rely on C-CoRN's structures¹ to build a better/more 
  compatible/popular Hierarchy organisation. It would be great to rely on C-CoRN to 
  prove things with minimal hypotheses (like JM did in Commutative_ring_binomial as a 
  little proof of concept) like guys in Nijmegen did on a regular basis. C-CoRN is 
  promising but quite hard to read. Maybe a great thing to put sugar in it.

Proof that e is transcendental
